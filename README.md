# Task 2 – Customer Retention & Churn Analysis Dashboard using Power BI

## Objective
To analyze customer subscription data and identify key churn patterns, retention drivers, and customer lifetime trends in order to help a subscription-based business reduce customer loss and improve long-term retention.

## Tools Used
- Power BI Desktop

## Dataset
- Telco Customer Churn Dataset (CSV)  
  The dataset contains customer demographics, service usage, billing information, contract types, tenure, and churn status.

## Steps Performed
- Imported the customer churn dataset into Power BI  
- Cleaned and prepared the data (handled null values, corrected data types, and standardized fields)  
- Created calculated measures for:
  - Total Customers
  - Churned Customers
  - Churn Rate
  - Retention Rate
- Segmented customers based on:
  - Contract type
  - Customer tenure
  - Payment method
- Designed KPI cards to present overall retention health  
- Built visualizations to analyze:
  - Customer churn distribution by contract type
  - Churn rate trends across customer lifetime
  - Retention drivers using payment method analysis
  - Key churn contributors using a decomposition tree
- Designed a clean, business-friendly dashboard layout focused on decision-making  

## Key Insights
- Month-to-month contract customers exhibit the highest churn compared to long-term contract customers  
- Customer churn is most concentrated within the first six months of the customer lifecycle  
- Customers using electronic check payment methods have a significantly higher churn rate  
- Long-term contracts and automatic payment methods strongly improve customer retention  

## Business Recommendations
- Encourage customers to switch from month-to-month contracts to annual or multi-year plans through discounts or loyalty benefits  
- Improve onboarding and engagement efforts during the first six months to reduce early-stage churn  
- Promote automatic payment methods to minimize payment-related friction and improve retention  
- Identify high-risk customer segments and proactively target them with personalized offers or support  

## Conclusion
This dashboard delivers business-focused insights that help stakeholders understand customer churn behavior and identify practical strategies to improve retention and customer lifetime value.
